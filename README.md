## About FL Studio Backups

FL Studio creates backup files when you save projects. These files are stored in a "Backup" folder within your project folder with the naming format "Project Name (overwritten at XXhYY).flp". While these backups are useful, they can consume significant disk space over time.

This utility helps you manage these backups by keeping only the most recent backup for each project, saving disk space while maintaining a safety net in case you need to recover work.
